# tidyRcourse

This R course has been developed by Brian Williams. 

The Book folder contains the book, and the R_Course folder accompanying lectures and tutorials.

To build the book use knitr::knit2pdf("tidyRcourseBook.Rnw", bib_engine = "biber") . Compiling to pdf from within RStudio might not work. 


A compiled version of the book resides in the root folder, instructions for the course can be found in the Preliminaries.pdf file in the tidyRcourse folder.
